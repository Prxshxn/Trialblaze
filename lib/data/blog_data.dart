        "Proper hydration and nutrition aren't just good practices—they're essential survival tools for any hiker. Even on short trails, your body needs consistent fuel to perform at its best.\n\n"
        "Water should be your constant companion. The general rule? Drink before you're thirsty. By the time thirst kicks in, you're already dehydrated. Aim for about half a liter per hour of moderate activity, and more in hot weather or at higher elevations.\n\n"
        "For nutrition, think beyond the basic trail mix. Complex carbs provide sustained energy, while proteins help repair muscles during and after your hike. Pack easy-to-eat foods that won't spoil: nut butters, jerky, dried fruits, and energy bars are perfect trail companions.\n\n"
        "Remember: what you consume on the trail directly impacts your energy levels, decision-making ability, and overall safety. Plan your hydration and nutrition strategy as carefully as you plan your route!",

        "A multi-day hike transforms a simple walk into an adventure—but requires thoughtful preparation. Here's how to ensure your extended journey stays memorable for all the right reasons:\n\n"
        "Plan meticulously: Study your route, identify water sources, camping spots, and potential exit points. Share your itinerary with someone not joining the hike.\n\n"
        "Pack smart, not heavy: Every unnecessary ounce feels like a pound by day three. Prioritize the essentials: shelter, sleep system, water filtration, first aid, navigation tools, and appropriate clothing layers.\n\n"
        "Break in your gear: Never take new boots on a long hike. Test all equipment beforehand, especially your backpack and sleeping system.\n\n"
        "Train gradually: Build endurance by taking progressively longer day hikes with a loaded pack. Include some terrain similar to what you'll encounter.\n\n"
        "Master cooking simply: Plan nutritious, calorie-dense meals that require minimal preparation. Pre-portion ingredients to reduce waste and weight.\n\n"
        "Prepare mentally: Multi-day hiking tests your resolve as much as your body. Embrace discomfort as part of the journey and remember why you chose this adventure.\n\n"
        "The trail teaches patience and resilience. With proper preparation, you'll be ready for whatever challenges—and wonders—await around the next bend.",

        "4. Use a Foam Roller: Roll out tight muscles to release tension and improve blood flow.\n\n"
